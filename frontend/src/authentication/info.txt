This page contains the options to choose i.e., if the user is admin or service agent or customer.
Based on the user input(say customer), it will then redirect the page to respective signIn/sighUp pages(for customer here) which are located inside the respective folder(customer here).
Also, service agent and Admin will only have the signIn page and not the signUp page. The admin will have the authority to add new service agents.
